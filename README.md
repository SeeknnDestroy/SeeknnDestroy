## 🚀 Highlights
- **Platform Architect:** Spearheaded the ground-up migration of all AI functionalities from a C# monolith to a high-performance, containerized Python microservices platform for a system serving **80+ B2B customers**.
- **Open Source Creator:** Engineered and launched **[AutoLLM](https://github.com/safevideo/autollm)**, a popular open-source framework that simplifies RAG development, achieving over **80,000 downloads** and **1,000+ GitHub stars**.
- **Performance Optimizer:** Re-architected a RAG retrieval engine using **Milvus** and an **HNSW** index, slashing search latency by **~99%** (from 500ms to <5ms).
- **Product Innovator:** Transformed a legacy chatbot into a multi-agent system, replacing a costly manual webhook process with a no-code API framework and cutting client deployment times from weeks to hours.
- **AI Researcher:** Led R&D on **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** for automated video analysis and built an **LLM-as-a-Judge** framework to programmatically evaluate model faithfulness and quality.
- **National Award Winner:**  Led my team to **1st Place** out of 127 teams in the National AI in Healthcare Competition at TEKNOFEST 2022.
